This project can help you debug a service hosted in an ACA (Azure Container Apps) environment.
The concept is to install a wrapper in the environment that redirects calls to your local machine (allowing you to debug the service locally)

# Global architecture

![architecture](docs/Archi20241214.png)


# Installation

There are 2 parts to install : One server and one client at minimum

## Server installation

There are 2 installation modes

1) one instance that "wrap"" multiple services : one per tunnelId. This mode allow to use one server with multiple clients.
2) one instance that "wrap" one service : this mode is usefull in replacement of your service to debug. This mode allow to use one server with one client only. 

For both modes, there is only one docker image => ghcr.io/pgourlain/pgrok:latest 
1) deploy ghcr.io/pgourlain/pgrok:latest into your aca environment
2) allow ingress with target port 8080

## Check server installation

after deploying server, open in browser url of ingress (example https://pgrok--xxxx.xxxxxx.westeurope.azurecontainerapps.io/$)


## Client installation

```shell
dotnet tool install --global pgrok-client
```





# Limitations

On client side :
- Calling another service (in ACA) from local is not yet implemented.
